# Purpose:
#    Number scrabble is played with the list of numbers between 1 and 9. Each player takes
#    turns picking a number from the list. Once a number has been picked, it cannot be picked
#    again. If a player has picked three numbers that add up to 15, that player wins the game.
#    However, if all the numbers are used and no player gets exactly 15, the game is a draw.

# Function to check if 3 numbers in the list sum to 15
